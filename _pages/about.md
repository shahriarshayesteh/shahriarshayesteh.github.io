I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/sxs7285), where I contribute to the [PrivaSeer Project](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/people) under the supervision of [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/index.html) and [Dr. C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Responsible AI**, and **Human-Centred Computing**.

## üîç Research Interests

My research aims to build tools and frameworks that promote transparency, fairness, and safety in AI systems. Specific areas of interest include:

- **User Privacy Right Analysis**: Large-scale extraction and analysis of privacy practices in web or LLM-based apps to discover shortcomings in addressing users' rights in data collection and data sharing practices.
- **Tool Use Safety in LLM Agents and LLMs**: Investigating failure modes and robustness challenges in tool-calling and execution behaviour of LLMs and agents.

## üß™ Ongoing Projects

1. **Sectoral Norm Discovery: Sectoral Analysis of Website Privacy Notices**  
   Uncovering sector-specific data practices to define normative patterns in privacy notices across industries.

2. **Tool Selection Safety: Are LLMs Robust to Perturbations in Tool Descriptions?**  
   Evaluating how LLMs handle tool selection under adversarial prompt perturbations in in-context learning.

3. **Defence Mechanisms for AgentPoison: Red-Teaming LLM Agents via Memory Poisoning**  
   Designing agents that detect, resist, and cleanse memory from red-teaming attacks involving poisoned prompts.
