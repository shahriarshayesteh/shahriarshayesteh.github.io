I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/), where I contribute to the [PrivaSeer Project](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/index.html) and [Dr. C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Responsible AI**, and **Human-Centered Computing**.

## üîç Research Interests

My research aims to build tools and frameworks that promote transparency, fairness, and safety in AI systems. Specific areas of interest include:

- **Privacy Policy Analysis**: Large-scale extraction and analysis of privacy practices across industry sectors using NLP and knowledge graph construction.
- **Safety in Foundation Models and LLM Agents**: Investigating vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents (e.g., red teaming, alignment challenges), with an emphasis on reasoning reliability and human-aligned behavior.

## üß™ Ongoing Projects

1. **Sectoral Norm Discovery: Sectoral Analysis of Website Privacy Notices**  
   Uncovering sector-specific data practices to define normative patterns in privacy notices across industries.

2. **Tool Selection Safety: Are LLMs Robust to Perturbations in Tool Descriptions?**  
   Evaluating how LLMs handle tool selection under adversarial prompt perturbations in in-context learning.

3. **Defense Mechanisms for AgentPoison: Red-Teaming LLM Agents via Memory Poisoning**  
   Designing agents that detect, resist, and cleanse memory from red-teaming attacks involving poisoned prompts.
