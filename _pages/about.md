I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/sxs7285), where I contribute to the [PrivaSeer Project](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/people) under the supervision of [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/index.html) and [Dr. C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Responsible AI**, and **Human-Centred Computing**.

## 🔍 Research Interests

My research aims to build tools and frameworks that promote transparency and safety for users in AI systems. Specific areas of interest include:

- **User Privacy Right Analysis**: I develop automated methods to audit the privacy policies and data-handling practices of websites and AI applications at scale. The goal is to uncover where these practices fall short of protecting user rights, holding technologies accountable to their promises.
- **Tool Use Safety in LLM Agents and LLMs**:  As LLMs begin to take actions in the real world by using tools (like APIs), their potential for failure becomes more dangerous. I investigate the robustness of this tool-calling behavior, identifying critical failure points and developing safeguards to prevent unintended consequences.

## 🧪 Ongoing Projects

1. **Sectoral Norm Discovery: Sectoral Analysis of Website Privacy Notices**  
   Uncovering sector-specific data practices to define normative patterns in privacy notices across industries.

2. **Tool Selection Safety: Are LLMs Robust to Perturbations in Tool Descriptions?**  
   Evaluating how LLMs handle tool selection under adversarial prompt perturbations in in-context learning.

3. **Large-Scale Exploration and Interpretation of Consumer-Oriented Legal Documents(COLDs)**  
   Application of LLMs and AI-agentic frameworks to eliminate obstacles toward enhancing consumers’ understanding of many legal
documents that they are expected to agree on.
